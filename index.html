 Artificial intelligence is a technology which enables a machine to simulate human behavior. Machine learning is a subset of AI which allows a machine to automatically learn from past data without programming explicitly. Machine learning and AI are used interchangeably. 

 <br>
 <br>

 Like any other thing in this world Artificial Intelligence & Machine learning alsoh as its pros and cons.

   <h2><i><br><font color="white">Uses of AI</font></i></h2>
  
   <h3>Below are some AI applications that you may not realise are AI-powered:</h3>
   <br>
   

 	<li>
 		<b><u>Onlne shopping and advertising</u></b>
 		<br>
 		Artificial intelligence is widely used to provide personalised recommendations to people, based for example on their previous searches and purchases or other online behaviour. AI is hugely important in commerce: optimising products, planning inventory, logistics etc.
 	</li>

    <br>
    <br>

    <li>
 		<b><u>Web searches</u></b>
 		<br>
 		Search engines learn from the vast input of data, provided by their users to provide relevant search results.
 	</li>

    <br>
    <br>

 	<li>
 		<b><u>Digital personal assistants</u></b>
 		<br>
 		Smartphones use AI to provide services that are as relevant and personalised as possible. Virtual assistants answering questions, providing recommendations and helping organise daily routines have become ubiquitous.
 	</li>

    <br>
    <br>

    <li>
 		<b><u>Machine translations</u></b>
 		<br>
 		Language translation software, either based on written or spoken text, relies on artificial intelligence to provide and improve translations. This also applies to functions such as automated subtitling.

 	</li>

 	<br>
    <br>

 	<li>
 		<b><u>Smart homes, cities and infrastructure</u></b>
 		<br>
 		Smart thermostats learn from our behaviour to save energy, while developers of smart cities hope to regulate traffic to improve connectivity and reduce traffic jams.

 	</li>

 	<br>
    <br>

    <li>
 		<b><u>Cars</u></b>
 		<br>
 		
     While self-driving vehicles are not yet standard, cars already use AI-powered safety functions. The EU has for example helped to fund VI-DAS, automated sensors that detect possible dangerous situations and accidents.
     <br>
     Navigation is largely AI-powered.

 	</li>

 	<br>
    <br>

 	<li>
 		<b><u>Cybersecurity</u></b>
 		<br>
 		AI systems can help recognise and fight cyberattacks and other cyber threats based on the continuous input of data, recognising patterns and backtracking the attacks.
 	</li>

 	<br>
    <br>

    <li>
 		<b><u>Artificial intelligence against Covid-19</u></b>
 		<br>
 		In the case of Covid-19, AI has been used in thermal imaging in airports and elsewhere. In medicine it can help recognise infection from computerised tomography lung scans. It has also been used to provide data to track the spread of the disease.

 	</li>

    <br>
    <br>

    <li>
 		<b><u>Health</u></b>
 		<br>
 		Researchers are studying how to use AI to analyse large quantities of health data and discover patterns that could lead to new discoveries in medicine and ways to improve individual diagnostics.

 	</li>

    <h2><i><br><font color="white">Uses of Machine Learning</font></i></h2>
   <br>

 	<li>
 		<b><u>Image Recognition</u></b>
 		<br>
 		The image recognition is one of the most common uses of machine learning applications. It can also be referred to as a digital image and for these images, the measurement describes the output of every pixel in an image. The face recognition is also one of the great features that have been developed by machine learning only. It helps to recognize the face and send the notifications related to that to people.
 	</li>

    <br>
    <br>

    <li>
 		<b><u>Voice Recognition</u></b>
 		<br>
 		Machine learning (ML) also helps in developing the application for voice recognition. It also referred to as virtual personal assistants (VPA). It will help you to find the information when asked over the voice. After your question, that assistant will look out for the data or the information that has been asked by you and collect the required information to provide you with the best answer. There are many devices available in today’s world of Machine learning for voice recognition that is Amazon echo and googles home is the smart speakers. There is one mobile app called Google allo and smartphones are Samsung S8 and Bixby.
 	</li>

    <br>
    <br>

 	<li>
 		<b><u>Predictions</u></b>
 		<br>
 		It helps in building the applications that predict the price of cab or travel for a particular duration and congestion of traffic where can be found. While booking the cab and the app estimates the approximate price of the trip that is done by the uses of machine learning only. When do we use GPS service to check the route from source to destination, the app will show us the various ways to go and check the traffic on that moment for the lesser number of vehicles and where the congestion of traffic is more that is done or retrieved by the uses of machine learning application.
 	</li>

    <br>
    <br>

    <li>
 		<b><u>Videos Surveillance</u></b>
 		<br>
 		It helps to detect the crime or any miss happening that is going to happen before it happens. It helps in tracking the unusual behavior of people like napping on benches and standing still from a long time, stumbling etc. and it will create an automatic alert to the guards or people who all are posted there and they can help to avoid any issues or problems.
 	</li>

 	<br>
    <br>

 	<li>
 		<b><u>Social Media Platform</u></b>
 		<br>
 		Social Media is being used for providing better news feed and advertisement as per the user’s interest is mainly done through the uses of machine learning only. There are many examples like friend suggestions, page suggestions for Facebook, songs, and videos suggestion on YouTube. It mainly works on the straightforward concept on the basis of the user’s experience, with which they are getting connected and visit the profiles or websites very often, suggestions are providing to the user accordingly. It also provides the technique to extract useful information from images and videos

 	</li>

 	<br>
    <br>

    <li>
 		<b><u>Spam and Malware</u></b>
 		<br>
 		
     Email clients use a number of spam filtering and these spam filters are continuously getting updated and these are mainly done by the uses of machine learning. Rule-based, multi-layer and tree induction are some of the techniques that are provided by machine learning. Similarly, a number of malware are detected and these are detected mainly by the system security programs that are mainly helped by machine learning only

 	</li>

 	<br>
    <br>

 	<li>
 		<b><u>Customer Support</u></b>
 		<br>
 		Most of the reputed companies or many websites provide the option to chat with a customer support representative. So, after asking any query by the customer, it is not compulsory that the answer is given by the human only, sometimes the answers are given by the chatbot which extracts the information from the website and provides the answer to customers. Now they are better and understand the queries quickly and faster and also provides a good result by giving appropriate result and it is done by the uses of machine learning only.
 	</li>

 	<br>
    <br>

    <li>
 		<b><u>Search Engine</u></b>
 		<br>
 		There are search engines available while searching to provide the best results to customers. There are many machine learning algorithms created for searching the particular user query like for google. Whatever the page is being opened by the users for a particular topic frequently that will remain at the top of the page for a long time.

 	</li>

    <br>
    <br>

    <li>
 		<b><u>Applications/Companies</u></b>
 		<br>
 		There are many applications and companies that used machine learning for doing their day to day process as it is being more accurate and precise than manual interventions. These companies are Netflix, facebook, google maps, Gmail, Google search etc.
